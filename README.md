# Assignment-17.3

Problem Statement:

Two balls are drawn at random in succession without replacement from an urn containing 4 red balls and 6 black balls.
Find the probabilities of all the possible outcomes.

Solution:

All possible outcomes:  RR, RB, BR, BB

Now, the probability of getting 2 red balls when we draw out the balls one at a time is:

Probability of first ball being red =4/10
Probability of second ball being red = 3/9 (since there are 3 red balls left in the urn and 9 balls in total)

P(RR) = 4/10 * 3/9 = 2/15 = 0.13

Similarly, probability of 1st ball red is 4/10 and 2nd black is 6/9

P(RB) = 4/10 * 6/9 = 4/15 = 0.26

probability of 1st ball black is 6/10 and 2nd red is 4/9

P(BR) = 6/10 * 4/9 = 4/15 = 0.26

And, probability of 1st black is 6/10 and 2nd black is 5/9

P(BB) = 6/10 * 5/9 = 1/3 = 0.33
